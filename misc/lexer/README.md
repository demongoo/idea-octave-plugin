Lexer generation
================

Lexer definition is created from YYLEX file lex.ll taken from Octave source code.
Lexer Java class (_OctaveLexer) is generated using [JFlex](http://jflex.de/download.html),
and should be placed into org.intellij.plugins.octave.lang.lexer.

Note: I used IntelliJ IDEA plugin "JFlex Support" instead of command-line.
